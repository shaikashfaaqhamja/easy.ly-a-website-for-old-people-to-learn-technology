                        <center>An electric vehicle (EV)[note 1] is a vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for
                            propulsion. It can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular
                            sources, or it can be powered autonomously by a battery (sometimes charged by solar panels,
                            or by converting fuel to electricity using fuel cells or a generator).</center>

                        <center>EVs first came into existence in the late 19th century, when electricity was among the
                            preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of
                            operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Internal combustion
                            engines were the dominant propulsion method for cars and trucks for about 100 years, but
                            electric power remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as trains and smaller
                            vehicles of all types.</center>

                        <center>Government incentives to increase adoption were first introduced in the late 2000s,
                            including in the United States and the European Union, leading to a growing market for the
                            vehicles in the 2010s.[3][4] Increasing public interest and awareness and structural
                            incentives, such as those being built into the green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, is
                            expected to greatly increase the electric vehicle market

                            gasoline or diesel vehicles.[5] The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that
                            governments should do more to meet climate goals, including policies for heavy electric
                            vehicles.[6] Electric vehicle sales may increase from 2% of global share in 2016 to 30% by
                            2030.</center>

                            2020 literature review suggested that growth in use of electric 4-wheeled vehicles appears
                            economically unlikely in developing economies, but that electric 2-wheeler growth is
                            likely.[10] There are more 2 and 3 wheel EVs than any other type</center>
