                            over the internet. The service is delivered “over the top” of another platform, hence the
                            moniker.</center>

                            provider would be responsible for the supply and availability of programming. In the modern
                            era, users can sign up for services like Netflix or Spotify and access their offerings over
                            the internet.</center>

                        <center>Because OTT is a relatively new phenomenon, there is a huge amount of growth potential.
                            Lots of companies are entering the OTT space, leading to a wide variety of options for
                            consumers, and increasing quantities of ad inventory for marketers.which provide users with
                            a number of programming options, both in terms of a licensed library of TV shows and films,
                            as well as original programming.</center>

                        <center> As more people cut the cord and move towards online-only media consumption, the way to
                            reach these consumers will increasingly be via OTT services. How marketers can take
                            advantage of these platforms remains, widely, to be seen.The type of OTT service most users
                            probably interact with most regularly is video OTT. Services like Netflix, Hulu or
                            Disney+HotStar are video OTT services,

                        <center>Many OTT services operate on a paid subscription basis, but a large number also run
                            advertisements — or offer tiered packages that allow users to either pay for ad-free
                            experiences. OTT marketing is much like legacy media advertising, usually taking place
                            between songs or episodes, but it is delivered through the streaming media on OTT platforms.

                    <p>
                        <center>In a client-side setup, the viewport for the streaming media loads the ad before the
                            episode or film is shown. In a server-side ad insertion, the ad is integrated seamlessly
                            into the frames of the media, meaning it is not possible to ad-block. However, it is a much
                            more technically challenging proposition to support server-side ad insertion, so it is still
                            relatively uncommon.</center>
