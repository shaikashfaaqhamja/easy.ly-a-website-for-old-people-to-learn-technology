                        <center>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a
                            medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority,
                            such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.It is a decentralized system for
                            verifying that the parties to a transaction have the money they claim to have, eliminating
                            the need for traditional intermediaries, such as banks, when funds are being transferred
                            between two entities.</center>

                        <center>Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a
                            computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control
                            the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.
                            Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional
                            sense and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as
                            commodities, securities, as well as currencies</center>

                        <center>Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not
                            issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as
                            opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).[11] When a cryptocurrency is minted or
                            created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered
                            centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through
                            distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial
                            transaction database </center>

                        <center>In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic
                            electronic money called ecash. Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,an early
                            form of cryptographic electronic payments. Digicash required user
                            software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before
                            it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a
                            third party.

                            In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the
                            Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a cryptocurrency system.

                        <center>In the 1997 book The Sovereign Individual, the authors, William Rees-Mogg and James Dale
                            Davidson, predict that the currency used in the information age would be using "mathematical
                            algorithms that have no physical existence",which has led some in the cryptocurrency
                            community to call the book's claim a "prophecy". </center>

                        <center>In January 2009, Bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used
                            SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.In April 2011,
                            Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS. In October 2011, Litecoin
                            was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Peercoin, created in
                            August 2012, used a hybrid of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.</center>
