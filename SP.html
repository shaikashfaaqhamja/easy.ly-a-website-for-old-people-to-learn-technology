                        <center>A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone and computing
                            functions into one unit. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger
                            hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider
                            software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia
                            functionality</center>

                        <center>Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market, attempting to
                            bridge the functionality of standalone personal digital assistant (PDA) devices with support
                            for cellular telephony, but were limited by their bulky form, short battery life, slow
                            analog cellular networks, and the immaturity of wireless data services. These issues were
                            eventually resolved with the exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS transistors down
                            to sub-micron levels (Moore's law), the improved lithium-ion battery,</center>

                        <center>In the 2000s, NTT DoCoMo's i-mode platform, BlackBerry, Nokia's Symbian platform, and
                            Windows Mobile began to gain market traction, with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards
                            or resistive touchscreen input, and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet.
                            Following the rising popularity of the iPhone in the late 2000s, the majority of smartphones
                            have featured thin, slate-like form factors, with large, capacitive screens </center>

                        <center>The development of the smartphone was enabled by several key technological advances. The
                            exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOSFETs (MOS transistors) down to sub-micron
                            levels during the 1990s–2000s (as predicted by Moore's law) made it possible to build
                            portable smart devices such as smartphones,as well as enabling the transition from
                            analog to faster digital wireless mobile networks (leading to Edholm's law). Other
                            important enabling factors include the lithium-ion battery, an indispensable energy source
                            enabling long battery life

                        <center>In the early 1990s, IBM engineer Frank Canova realised that chip-and-wireless technology
                            was becoming small enough to use in handheld devices.The first commercially available
                            device that could be properly referred to as a "smartphone" began as a prototype called
                            "Angler" developed by Canova in 1992 while at IBM and demonstrated in November of that year
                            at the COMDEX computer industry trade show.A refined version was marketed to
                            consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator. </center>

                            its own wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) and cellular radio technologies. It
                            featured a liquid-crystal display (LCD) and PC Card support.[The Simon was commercially
                            unsuccessful, particularly due to its bulky form factor and limited battery life,using
                            NiCad batteries rather than the nickel–metal hydride batteries commonly used in mobile
                            phones in the 1990s, or lithium-ion batteries used in modern smartphones.</center>
