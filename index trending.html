                            <div class="panel-body">> 5G will account for more than a third of total connections in India
                                by 2030, with the share of 2G and 3G dwindling to less than 10 per cent, a recent report
                                had said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 5G services in India today at a telecom
                                event in Delhi. The service is expected to progressively cover the entire country over
                                the next couple of years, potentially transforming India's digital landscape. After
                                inaugurating the exhibition, PM Modi went around pavilions set up by different telecom
                                operators and technology providers to get a first-hand experience of what 5G can do. He
                                started with Reliance Jio's stalls, where he witnessed the 'True 5G' devices displayed
                                and experienced the use case through Jio Glass.</div>

                            <div class="panel-body">> Scientists have discovered a reservoir of water three times the
                                volume of all the oceans beneath the Earth's surface, according to an international
                                study. The water has been found between the transition zone of the Earth's upper and
                                lower mantle. The research team analyzed a rate diamond formed 660 meters below the
                                Earth's surface using techniques including Raman spectroscopy and FTIR spectrometry, ANI
                                reported.
                                The study confirmed something that for a long time it was just a theory, namely that
                                ocean water accompanies subducting slabs and thus enters the transition zone. This means
                                that our planet's water cycle includes the Earth's interior."These mineral
                                transformations greatly hinder the movements of rock in the mantle," explains Prof.
                                Frank Brenker from the Institute for Geosciences at Goethe University in Frankfurt. For
                                example, mantle plumes -- rising columns of hot rock from the deep mantle -- sometimes
                                stop directly below the transition zone. The movement of mass in the opposite direction
                                also comes to standstill.

                                Brenker says, "Subducting plates often have difficulty in breaking through the entire
                                transition zone. So there is a whole graveyard of such plates in this zone underneath
                                Europe."

                                However, until now it was not known what the long-term effects of "sucking" material
                                into the transition zone were on its geochemical composition and whether larger
                                quantities of water existed there. Brenker explains: "The subducting slabs also carry
                                deep-sea sediments piggyback into the Earth's interior. These sediments can hold large
                                quantities of water and CO2. But until now it was unclear just how much enters the
                                transition zone in the form of more stable, hydrous minerals and carbonates -- and it
                                was therefore also unclear whether large quantities of water really are stored there."

                                maker Mercedes-Benz to produce more cars locally and emphasised that such a move reduces
                                the cost besides increasing affordability.
                                Speaking at the rollout of Mercedes-Benz India's first locally assembled EQS 580 4MATIC
                                EV from its Chakan manufacturing facility in Pune, Gadkari, who is the Minister for Road
                                Transport and highways, said that there is a huge market for electric vehicles in the
                                country."You increase the production, only then it is possible to reduce cost. We are
                                middle-class people, even I can't afford your car," the minister said.

                                The latest EV from the German car maker comes with a price tag of ₹ 1.55 crore.

                                The EQS 580 joins the company's EQC SUV and AMG EQS53 4MATIC flagship EV.

                                Mercedes-Benz India started its electro-mobility drive in India with the launch of its
                                all-electric SUV EQC as a fully imported unit in October 2020 priced at ₹ 1.07 crore.

                                There are a total of 15.7 lakh registered electric vehicles in the country, according to
                                Mr Gadkari.

                                There is a huge market with the overall EV sales rising 335 per cent, he said, adding
                                that with the express highways coming up in the country, Mercedes-Benz India will get a
                                good market for these cars.

                                Ashok Gehlot's meeting with Sonia Gandhi on Thursday concluded with the Rajasthan Chief
                                Minister quitting the race for Congress President as well as a symbolic capitulation,
                                but his notes for the session have painted an entirely different picture.
                                Captured by Malayala Manorama photographer J Suresh, a photo of the cheat-sheet Mr
                                Gehlot carried into the meeting has offered rare insight into the points he most likely
                                raised with Ms Gandhi.The picture reveals a charge-sheet of sorts against Mr Gehlot's
                                younger rival, Sachin Pilot. It was Sachin Pilot's probable appointment as Chief
                                Minister if Mr Gehlot moved to Delhi to lead the party, that had spurred an all-out
                                revolt by MLAs loyal to the latter and thus the end of the plan.

                                Making severe allegations against Sachin Pilot, referred to as 'SP', Mr Gehlot's notes
                                claimed he enjoyed the "support of 102 MLAs as against 18" by his rival and that there
                                was every chance of the younger Congress leader "quitting the party for political
                                gains".They also accused Sachin Pilot of having attempted to "overthrow" the Congress
                                government in the state as state party chief in collusion with the BJP, which had tried
                                to buy out MLAs by offering ₹ 10 to 50 crore.

                            <div class="panel-body">> Since making his debut in the Indian Premier League in 2019,
                                Arshdeep Singh's stocks have been on the rise. The pacer had an excellent IPL 2022
                                season and went on to make his international debut during the tour of England. He then
                                bagged seven wickets during the tour of West Indies. He played for India at the Asia Cup
                                in last month, but didn't have the best of outings. However, the young pacer made a
                                strong comeback in the first T20I against South Africa earlier this week.

                                Arshdeep, who was rested for the T20I series against Australia, struck thrice in his
                                first over.The Proteas batters looked clueless while facing Arshdeep, who ended the
                                match with figures of three for 32 on a swinging pitch in Thiruvananthapuram.

                                Speaking on Arshdeep's performance, former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal
                                drew comparisons with a left-arm pace icon from India.

                                "Arshdeep Singh is an incredible bowler. I think India have found their new Zaheer
                                Khan," Akmal said in a video uploaded on his YouTube channel.Arshdeep has both, pace and
                                swing, and he has that bowling intelligence. He's mentally strong and knows his
                                abilities, and uses them according to the conditions," he explained.

                                Akmal also added that despite being young, Arshdeep possess bowling intelligence and
                                maturity, which is a good sign for the Indian team."He first got Rilee Rossouw
                                caught-behind, and then castled De Kock. But the best wicket was that of David Miller
                                because he kept getting the ball to move away from him before bowling a sharp inswinger
                                to bowl him out. He bowls brilliant and he is mature, has pace and is still young. It's
                                a good sign for Team India because they needed a left-armer after Zaheer Khan," he
                                added.

                                Notably, Arshdeep has been selected in the 15-man squad for the T20 World Cup in
                                Australia.

                                United States sanctioned an Indian company for purchasing Iranian petroleum and
                                petrochemicals.
                                The India-based petrochemical company, Tibalaji Petrochem Private Limited, is among a
                                group of companies, including some from the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, to be
                                sanctioned by the US. The sanctions have targeted Iranian brokers and several front
                                companies in India, UAE and Hong Kong that have facilitated financial transfers and
                                shipping of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products.According to the US Department
                                of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Tibalji Petrochem Pvt Ltd has
                                purchased millions of dollars worth of petrochemical products, including methanol and
                                base oil, from Triliance, an Iranian company that brokers the sale of Iranian products
                                to foreign purchasers, for onward shipment to China.

                                "Today, the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
                                sanctioned an international network of companies involved in the sale of hundreds of

                                brutalised by three friends, including a cousin, died this morning while in treatment at
                                the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Delhi government's Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan
                                Hospital (LNJP). All the children involved are between 10 and 12 years of age, from the
                                same community, and residents of northeast Delhi's New Seelampur area.
                                According to some reports, doctors reportedly said the boy's wounds were so gruesome
                                that they were reminded of the December 16, 2012 gang rape.The Seelampur police station
                                had on September 22 received a call from LNJP Hospital that a boy aged about 10 years
                                was admitted on account of physical assault that happened three days back. A police team
                                reached the hospital and met with the parents of the child, but they refused to give a
                                statement, cops said. The child was then under medical observation.

                                The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) had also issued a notice to the police in this
                                connection and demanded strict action against the accused. The DCW said it received a
                                complaint from a woman who said her son was sexually assaulted by people who even
                                inserted a rod in his private parts.

                                Doctors say the family not bringing the boy to the hospital for four days worsened his
                                condition.

                                The family did not give a statement till September 24. After counselling arranged by the
                                police, the boy's mother eventually disclosed that her son was physically assaulted and
                                sodomised by his three friends over a debt that the family was having trouble paying
                                back on time.

                                Based on her statement, a case was registered under section 377 (Unnatural offences) and
                                34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Protection Of Children Sexual
