However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion.

                            <div class="panel-body">> Laptops typically have all the features of a desktop model but have a flat display screen, either a plasma panel or an LCD display, that folds over the keyboard when not in use.</div>
                            <div class="panel-body">> They are constructed from components chosen for their lightness, small size, and low power consumption. These tend to make laptops more expensive than their desktop equivalents.</div>
                            <div class="panel-body">> The first portable computer was the IBM 5100, released in September 1975. It weighed 55-pounds, which was much lighter and more portable than any other computer to date. While not truly a laptop by today’s standards, it paved the way for the development of truly portable computers, i.e., laptops.</div>

Despite this, they were very popular with the Military of the United States amd NASA, who used the laptop in its Space Shuttle program, in the 1980s.</div>

In 1986, the improved version, called TRS Model 200, was released, which had a much larger, fold-down LCD screen, and looked pretty much like the laptops that we know today.</div>
                            <div class="panel-body">> Hewlett-Packard released the Vectra Portable CS laptop in 1987. It was one of the first laptops to feature a 3 ½” floppy disk drive capable of using 1.44 MB diskettes.</div>
