                        <center>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the
                            natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans. AI research has been defined as the
                            field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its
                            environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[a]</center>

                        <center>The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that
                            mimic and display "human" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as
                            "learning" and "problem-solving". This definition has since been rejected by major AI
                            researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does
                            not limit how intelligence can be articulated.[b]</center>

                            Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the

                        <center>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years
                            since has experienced several waves of optimism,[6][7] followed by disappointment and the
                            loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[8][9] followed by new approaches, success and
                            renewed funding.[7][10] AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since
                            its founding, including simulating the brain

                            of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge
                            representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability
                            to move and manipulate objects.[c] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary
                            problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[12] </center>

                        <center>The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely
                            described that a machine can be made to simulate it".[d] This raised philosophical arguments
                            about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with
                            human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and
                            that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not
                            steered towards beneficial goals.[e]</center>
