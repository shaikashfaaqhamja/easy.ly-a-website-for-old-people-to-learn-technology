                        <center>Economic crisis is a period in an economic cycle in which an economy faces difficulties
                            for a
                            long time.It is a drastic fall in the economic performance of the country which is
                            manifested in
                            a decline in production and demand, rising unemployment and bankruptcy of businesses. This
                            will
                            automatically lead to high poverty levels in the country. A sharp deterioration in the
                            economic
                            state of the country, manifested in a significant decline in production; violation of
                            existing
                            production relations; bankruptcy of enterprises; and rising unemployment.</center>

                        <center>A currency crisis, also called a devaluation crisis,[5] is normally considered as part
                            of a
                            financial crisis. Kaminsky et al. (1998), for instance, define currency crises as occurring
                            when
                            a weighted average of monthly percentage depreciations in the exchange rate and monthly
                            percentage declines in exchange reserves exceeds its mean by more than three standard
                            deviations.</center>

                    <p>
                        <center>A speculative bubble exists in the event of large, sustained overpricing of some class
                            of assets.[6] One factor that frequently contributes to a bubble is the presence of buyers
                            who purchase an asset based solely on the expectation that they can later resell it at a
                            higher price, rather than calculating the income it will generate in the future. If there is
                            a bubble, there is also a risk of a crash in asset prices: market participants will go on
                            buying only as long as they expect others to buy, and when many decide to sell the price
                            will fall. </center>

                    <p>
                        <center>Leverage, which means borrowing to finance investments, is frequently cited as a
                            contributor to financial crises. When a financial institution (or an individual) only
                            invests its own money, it can, in the very worst case, lose its own money. But when it
                            borrows in order to invest more, it can potentially earn more from its investment, but it
                            can also lose more than all it has. Therefore, leverage magnifies the potential returns from
                            investment, but also creates a risk of bankruptcy.</center>

                        <center>Another factor believed to contribute to financial crises is asset-liability mismatch, a
                            situation in which the risks associated with an institution's debts and assets are not
                            appropriately aligned. For example, commercial banks offer deposit accounts that can be
                            withdrawn at any time and they use the proceeds to make long-term loans to businesses and
                            homeowners. The mismatch between the banks' short-term liabilities (its deposits) and its
                            long-term assets (its loans) is seen as one of the reasons bank runs occur </center>

                        <center>Governments have attempted to eliminate or mitigate financial crises by regulating the
                            financial sector. One major goal of regulation is transparency: making institutions'
                            financial situations publicly known by requiring regular reporting under standardized
                            accounting procedures. Another goal of regulation is making sure institutions have
                            sufficient assets to meet their contractual obligations,</center>
