                        <center>The term "metaverse" originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, as a
                            portmanteau of "meta" and "universe". Metaverse development is often
                            linked to advancing virtual reality technology due to increasing demands for
                            immersion.Recent interest in metaverse development is influenced by Web3,
                            a concept for a decentralized iteration of the internet. </center>

                            games.The 2003 virtual world platform Second Life is often described as the first
                            metaverse,as it incorporated many aspects of social media into a persistent
                            three-dimensional world with the user represented as an avatar, however historical claims of
                            metaverse development started soon after the term was coined. Early projects included Active
                            Worlds[20] and The Palace</center>

                            Horizon.In 2021, Facebook was renamed "Meta Platforms" and its chairman Mark
                            Zuckerberg[31] declared a company commitment to developing a metaverse.Many of the
                            virtual reality technologies advertised by Meta Platforms remain to be
                            developed.Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen criticised the move</center>

                        <center>In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic
                            electronic money called ecash. Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,an early
                            form of cryptographic electronic payments. Digicash required user
                            software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before
                            it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a
                            third party.

                            In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the
                            Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a cryptocurrency system.

                            sexual harassment occurring on the platform.[37][38][39] In 2021, Meta made a loss of over
                            $10 billion on its metaverse development department, with Mark Zuckerberg saying he expected
                            operating losses to "increase meaningfully" in 2022. </center>
